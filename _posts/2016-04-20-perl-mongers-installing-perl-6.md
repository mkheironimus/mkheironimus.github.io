Pointed people at a starting point for Perl 6 (Rakudo Star) installation at
tonight's [St Louis Perl
Mongers](http://www.meetup.com/St-Louis-Perl-Mongers/). It was a lot more
discussion than lab, but there's nothing wrong with that!

Making a few slides of links for people to refer to was also my first look at
the just-released [Showoff](https://github.com/puppetlabs/showoff) 0.12.0. When
I first saw the new default style I was... displeased. Now that I've seen what
it looks like on a big screen, the smaller font size doesn't bother me (though
I did increase it in my CSS).

Naturally, everybody is welcome at Perl Mongers. We meet on the 3rd Wednesday
of the month. See the [meetup.com
page](http://www.meetup.com/St-Louis-Perl-Mongers/) for details.
