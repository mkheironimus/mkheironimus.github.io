Did a little talk at [St Louis Perl
Mongers](http://www.meetup.com/St-Louis-Perl-Mongers/) about what I did on
[packergen](https://github.com/mkheironimus/packergen). It was a fun little
diversion from my usual routine.

I also used it as an excuse to try writing slides in
[ShowOff](https://github.com/puppetlabs/showoff). I think I'm not exactly the
right audience for it. Markdown is OK, but I don't like CSS or JavaScript.

Everyone is welcome to stop by Perl Mongers if you're in St Louis on the 3rd
Wednesday of the month. Details are on the [meetup.com
page](http://www.meetup.com/St-Louis-Perl-Mongers/).
