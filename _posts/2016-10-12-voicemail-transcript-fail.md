Google's voicemail transcripts are pretty neat. They do not, however, handle
accents very well. Sometimes messages from people with accents are completely
incomprehensible. For example, this recent call:

> Hey, right, as long as you turn right, and then I'll come as soon as possible
> alrighty, okay, you could even come see the Java front if he has the job
> market. I guess what the f\*\*\*. mediacom I said this number for chicken.

Or this one:

> This is regarding for dolphins in urology Raleigh County police academy plan
> back or contact metro 284 fair lance acceptable.

Or these:

> I have sent an email to you regarding the job tortilla married if you're
> interested. Can you please reply that way more elusive

> [...] trying to reach you regarding a job opening a dog wine down have also
> sent you an email.

> Hello Michael. This is bizarre ahmed.

These were trimmed to remove contact info, but otherwise they're just copied
out of Hangouts.
