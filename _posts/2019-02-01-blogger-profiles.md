Blogger makes it pretty quick and simple to throw a small site out on teh
interwebs, especially if you already have a Google account. BUT! The way the UI
is set up led me to assume that the settings for using a Google+ vs Blogger
profile were per-blog. That is not the case. The settings are global to your
account. This makes it somewhat inconvenient to use one Google account for
multiple Blogger blogs.

If you're a serious blogger, that won't matter because you'd want to have a dedicated account anyway. And I don't know that I would use Blogger for that anyway.

If you're just putting a quick informational site out there, it's a bit more of
a headache because you don't necessarily want to take the extra steps and deal
with multiple Google accounts for different purposes. One way you can work
around it is to use a Blogger account and give it a generic name, like "admin"
or "blogger" or "poster" or whatever.
